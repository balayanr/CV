\section*{projects}
\begin{tabularcv}
    February 2020 - November 2020 &       \textbf{Web scraping} @ K.K. Tree\newline 
                                Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline for a website that unifies listings from government tender websites.
                                The project is designed around \href{https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}{\textbf{Luigi}}, which schedules tasks to maximize server utilization. Each task handled a different website: loaded and navigated the page with \textbf{Selenium}, parsed the data by locating elements with XPATHs and used \textbf{Tabula} and \textbf{PDFMiner} to extract data from PDFs. The data is then handed back to Luigi in CSV files to be inserted into the \textbf{PostgreSQL database} in batches to optimize load. \textbf{Psycopg2} is used to get data from the database, \textbf{Boto3} is used to talk to AWS S3 to store PDFs and screenshots.
                                % \newline Frameworks and libraries used for the project: Luigi, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Tabula+Pandas, PDFMiner; Psycopg2 and Boto3. 
                                \newline Deployed on AWS EC2; Database is in PostgreSQL, deployed on AWS RDS; AWS S3 is used to store files for listings.
    \\[\vspacepar]
    % January 2020 &              \textbf{Database development for a system used to manage staff, tasks and billing.}\newline 
                                % Written in PostgreSQL, deployed on AWS RDS, as the rest of the application was using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    \\[\vspacepar]

    November 2019 &             \textbf{Crawling of Hello Work's Job Listings.}\newline 
                                A customer who wanted \href{https://www.oshigoto-shokai.jp/}{a page} that only contained listings relevant to their services. \newline 
                                Everything was deployed on AWS Lambda, with functions handling both server-side rendering for pages and crawling. Used BeautifulSoup for page parsing and Selenium to help with navigation, database in PostgreSQL and deployed on AWS.
    \\[\vspacepar]
    
    June 2018 - January 2020 & \textbf{Beep Shift} @ Kuon Technologies\newline 
                                At Kuon Technologies I worked on creating an AI that would assign employees to shifts created by the manager. The shifts were represented as a step curve, with number of people required at each time. The AI would transform that into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, with time constraints on employees (Overtime, maximum salary, etc) and on the shop (budget, position requirements). The model also allowed for managerial preferences, which the AI interpreted as a selection order via a heuristic function.
                                \newline Once the AI was ready, our customers provided us with text files with raw receipt printout data, which I had to parse and load into a database, perform feature selection and extraction from the parsed data and create a model that would predict the number of employees required to run the shop.
    \\[\vspacepar]
    CSC412 & \textbf{Solo Research Project: Exploiting Structure For Classification Of Handwritten Japanese Characters.}
    \begin{tabitemize}
        \item Developed a parser for the \href{http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/}{Electrotechnical Laboratory} datasets, which come incredibly compressed and required a bespoke decoding library.
        \item Tested 4 different architectures with 2 different goals: direct kanji classification and multilabel classification of radicals that make up the kanji.
        \item Used AWS EC2 p2.xlarge and c4.8xlarge instances to train the models in parallel.
        \item Compiled the report in \LaTeX, generally following standards used for publications.
        \item Published all source code and the report on \href{https://github.com/balayanr/kanji_recognition_412}{Github}
    \end{tabitemize}\\[\vspacepar]
    CSC384 & \textbf{Group Research Project: Constraint Satisfaction Problem Algorithm Analysis.}
    % \begin{tabitemize}
        \newline Was the \textit{de facto} team leader: provided the team with a selection of algorithms outside of the course's scope that would be interesting to analyze. Final selection was iterative improvement, path consistency, and a tree-specific algorithms.
        % \item Compiled the report in \LaTeX.

\section*{interests and hobbies}
\textbf{Artificial Intelligence}: I have always been interested with AI and inspired by its portrayal in science fiction. It is my dream to work on implementing a general AI. One of the most interesting roadblocks to me is the way humans interact with AI: in science fiction it is almost always seamless, like talking to another person. Personally I have always had interest in Natural Languages, so this is one of the fields I would like to study in depth.\\
\textbf{Sports}: I am an avid cyclist, runner and hiker. I used to train with the University of Toronto Road Racing team and participate in various local cycling events. Hiked to the top of Mount Fuji, as well as many mountains in Kansai region. I also enjoy diving and have various advanced diving certifications. \\
\textbf{Traveling}: I enjoy traveling whenever I have the opportunity. I have visited many countries, including Japan, Spain, France, Italy, England, Germany, Egypt, Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. Lately, I have been traveling with my road bike and touring in the places I visit.\\
\textbf{GunPla}: One of my favourite hobbies is building plastic model kits. Over time I have built dozens of kits from Mobile Suit Gundam and Warhammer 40K figurines.\\
% \textbf{Magic the Gathering}: I enjoy the card game as a challenge for building the best deck possible out of limited resources provided. Occasionally participate in tournaments.\\
%\textbf{Videogames}: I have interest in videogames of all genres, but my favourite games are mostly strategy-focused (Civilization, FTL: Faster Than Light, StarCraft 2).
